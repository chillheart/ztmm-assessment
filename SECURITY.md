## Security Measures

### Implemented Security Controls

#### Input Validation
- âœ… **SQL Injection Protection**: Comprehensive input validation and prepared statements
- âœ… **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- âœ… **CSRF Protection**: Token-based request validation
- âœ… **Input Length Limits**: Prevents buffer overflow attacks

#### Database Security
- âœ… **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use parameterized statements
- âœ… **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege
- âœ… **Data Validation**: Multi-layer validation (client and server)

- âœ… **Content Security Policy**: Restrictive CSP headers
- âœ… **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration

### Continuous Security Monitoring

#### Automated Scanning
- **GitHub CodeQL**: Daily static analysis scans
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Retire.js**: Detection of outdated/vulnerable JavaScript libraries
- **NPM Audit**: Regular package vulnerability assessments

#### Security Testing
- **Custom Security Tests**: Application-specific vulnerability tests
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end security verification
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Verify Downloads**: Check file hashes before installation

4. **Testing**: Run security tests before commits

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1**: Acknowledgment sent
3. **Day 3**: Initial assessment completed
4. **Day 7**: Target resolution for critical vulnerabilities
5. **Day 14**: Target resolution for high vulnerabilities
6. **Day 30**: Target resolution for medium vulnerabilities

## Security Advisory Process

When a security vulnerability is confirmed:

1. **Private Fix**: We develop and test a fix privately
2. **Security Advisory**: We create a GitHub Security Advisory
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with the reporter on disclosure timing
4. **Public Release**: We release the fix and public advisory simultaneously
5. **Credit**: We provide appropriate credit to the reporter (if desired)

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature
- **General Security Questions**: Create a discussion (for non-sensitive topics)
