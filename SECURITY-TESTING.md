## Security Configuration

The security configuration is defined in `security-config.ts` and includes:

### Content Security Policy
```typescript
csp: {
  defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
  scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net"],
  imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "blob:"],
  // ... additional directives
}
```

### Input Validation Rules
```typescript
validation: {
  maxInputLength: 10000,
  allowedFileTypes: ['.json', '.txt'],
  maxFileSize: 10485760, // 10MB
  sanitizeInput: true
}
```

### Security Headers
```typescript
security: {
  xFrameOptions: "DENY",
  xContentTypeOptions: "nosniff",
  xXSSProtection: "1; mode=block",
  strictTransportSecurity: "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
  referrerPolicy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

## Penetration Testing

### Automated Attack Simulation
The penetration testing suite simulates real-world attacks including:

1. **Advanced XSS Payloads**
   - Event-based XSS vectors
   - Protocol handler abuse
   - Data URI schemes
   - SVG-based attacks

2. **Injection Attacks**
   - SQL injection variants
   - NoSQL injection techniques
   - Command injection patterns
   - LDAP injection attempts

3. **Access Control Bypass**
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Direct object reference manipulation
   - Session manipulation

4. **Business Logic Attacks**
   - Race condition exploitation
   - Data integrity violations
   - Boundary condition testing

## Security Utilities

### SecurityTestUtils Class
Provides comprehensive testing utilities:

- `testXSSProtection()` - XSS vulnerability detection
- `testInjectionProtection()` - Injection attack testing
- `testCSPCompliance()` - CSP violation detection
- `testForHardcodedSecrets()` - Credential scanning
- `testErrorHandling()` - Information disclosure testing
- `testAccessControl()` - Authorization testing

### SecurityRules Class

- `sanitizeInput()` - Input sanitization
- `validateInputLength()` - Length validation
- `containsXSS()` - XSS pattern detection
- `containsSQLInjection()` - SQL injection detection
- `isInputSafe()` - Comprehensive safety check

### SecurityAuditLogger Class
Provides security event logging:

- `log()` - General security event logging
- `logInputValidationFailure()` - Input validation failures
- `logPotentialAttack()` - Attack attempt logging

## Test Results and Reporting

### Security Report Generation
The test suite generates comprehensive security reports including:

- Overall security posture (PASS/FAIL)
- Vulnerability counts by severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Location and payload information
- Remediation recommendations

### Expected Results
All security tests should pass with:
- 0 HIGH severity vulnerabilities
- Minimal MEDIUM/LOW severity findings
- Comprehensive coverage of OWASP Top 10

## Best Practices Enforced

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Output Encoding**: Data is properly encoded when displayed
3. **Error Handling**: Errors don't reveal sensitive information
4. **Access Control**: Proper validation of user permissions
5. **Secure Configuration**: CSP and security headers implemented
6. **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of dependencies
7. **Logging**: Security events are properly logged
8. **State Management**: Secure handling of application state

## Integration with CI/CD

Security tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
npm run ci:full  # Includes security tests
```

This ensures that security vulnerabilities are caught early in the development process.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep security test payloads current with latest threats
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular `npm audit` execution
3. **Penetration Testing**: Periodic manual security assessments
4. **Security Reviews**: Code review focus on security implications
5. **Incident Response**: Process for handling security findings

## Limitations and Considerations

### Client-Side Security
Since this is a client-side Angular application:
- Server-side security controls are not applicable
- Some OWASP Top 10 items have limited relevance
- Focus on client-side vulnerabilities and secure coding practices

### Testing Scope
- Tests focus on application logic security
- Infrastructure security is out of scope
- Network security testing not included
- Physical security not addressed

## Compliance and Standards

This security testing suite helps ensure compliance with:
- OWASP Top 10 2021
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
- SANS Top 25 Software Errors
- Angular Security Best Practices

## Contributing to Security Testing

When adding new features or components:

1. Add appropriate security tests
2. Update penetration test payloads
3. Review security configuration
4. Validate input sanitization
5. Test error handling
6. Check for information disclosure
7. Verify access controls

## Security Contact
